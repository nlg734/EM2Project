This project simulates a transverse wave traveling from one medium to another. 
Chapter 6, "Waves," of "Computational Physics, Second Edition" by Nicholas J. Giordano and Hisao Nakanishi was used as a reference. 

This project was created as an extra credit project for the Electromagnetism 2 course at Kansas State University. 
N. Graham wrote the code. K. Ventura and B. Archibeque put forth ideas for the project as well as ideas to refine the program.
